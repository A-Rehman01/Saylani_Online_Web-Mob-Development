        <h3 class="headvirus">The Current Status of the CoVID-19 Pandemic</h3>
        <p class="backend" id='backend'> CoVID-19 started infecting people in the city of Wuhan, China in mid-December
            of 2019. Within a month,
            more
            than ten thousand people were infected and hundreds had died. The death rate was about 16% in the first two
            weeks but reduced to about 4% by mid-February and currently stands at about 2%. The initial outbreak caused
            many people to die who would have survived if they had received medical treatment. Unfortunately, the Wuhan
            medical system was unable to treat the extremely large number of seriously ill people seeking help. Simply
            put, the large number of seriously ill people greatly exceeded hospital capacity. Consequently, many people
            who needed basic care for dehydration and fever could not find care. China now reports a death rate of 0.7%
            outside of Hubei Province.
            A death rate of 2% is about 13 times greater than the incidence of death from seasonal flu. During the last
            flu season, 2018/2019, CDC reports 35 million Americans caught the flu and about 56,000 people died
            establishing a death rate of 0.15%. If the same number of Americans, 35 million, became infected with
            CoVID-19 and the death rate was actually 2%, CoVID-19 could be responsible for 700,000 deaths. However,
            there are several reasons to believe that the death rate is much less than 2%.
